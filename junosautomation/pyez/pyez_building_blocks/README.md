# PyEZ Examples

This collection of PyEZ examples shows you few basic building blocks required in most of the automations developed using PyEZ. The idea of these examples are to demonstrate the capabilities of PyEZ. Consequently, the capture of few exceptions and validations have not been developed in these examples.

## Building Block 1: Collecting and parsing configuration

This example demonstrate how to collect configuration from the router and parse it using XML.

## Building Block 2: Collecting operational commands outputs

This example demonstrate how to collect operational commands output in XML.

## Building Block 3: PyEZ Tables

This example demonstrate how to leverage PyEZ tables to simplify the data manipulation retrieve using a RPC query.

## Building Block 4: Provisioning with PyEZ

This example demonstrate how to push configurations to the router in three different configuration formats (cnf, set and XML).

## Building Block 5: Using JSNAPy inside your PyEZ script

This example how to use JSNAPy with your PyEZ automation to perform validations.

## Building Block 6: Performing router configuration backup

This example demonstrate how to retrieve the configuration from multiple routers.

## Boilerplate

This is a suggestion of minimum Python code required to develop automation. It also suggest few Python modules that are very helpful when developing network automation.
